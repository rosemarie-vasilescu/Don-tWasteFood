This paper proposes a mobile application that aims to reduce food waste by developing a sustainable behavior among consumers. Users can manage the food they have in the refrigerator. Food can be added both by entering the name and by photographing the ingredients in the refrigerator, as well as the code of bars. The application will store the foods and assign them an expiration date, and will notify the user when an ingredient is about to exceed its expiration date.The expiration date of the food can be changed by the user later. Beneficiaries can search for recipes that use the ingredients stored in the database or certain indicated ingredients. The application can also display recipes by their name or other criteria such as the type of diet, inspirational cuisine or allergens. For a better organization of shopping, the application offers the possibility of writing a shopping list, and the ingredients can be added either from the description of the recipe, or from the screen dedicated to this operation.
